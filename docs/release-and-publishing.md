# Release And Publishing

This guide explains how changes move from `main` to release candidates, stable
tags, GitHub Releases, GHCR images, and the signed APT repository.

## Release Model

The repository is designed so that `main` is release-candidate-ready.

That means a successful validation run for a push to `main` can trigger the
entire release path automatically:

1. compute the next semantic version
2. create a prerelease tag `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.<n>`
3. validate prerelease asset and container publication
4. promote the same commit to a stable tag `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
5. publish stable assets, containers, and the signed APT repository

## Workflow Map

### Build and Validate

Purpose:

- formatting checks
- vet and tests
- native binary build
- binary smoke tests
- Debian package validation
- signed APT repository layout validation
- website validation

This is the gate that must pass before automatic release automation acts on a
push to `main`.

### Automated Release Candidate

Trigger:

- successful `Build and Validate` completion for a push to `main`
- manual `workflow_dispatch`

Behavior:

- checks whether `HEAD` already carries a release tag
- runs `scripts/next-release.sh`
- skips tagging if no release-bearing commits are queued
- creates the next `-rc` tag when a release is required
- dispatches `container-image.yml` and `release-assets.yml` from the current
  default branch with the target tag passed explicitly
- waits for those prerelease publish paths to succeed
- creates the stable tag from the same commit
- dispatches the stable publish workflows

Recovery path:

- if a tagged publish ever needs to be replayed, dispatch the publish workflow
  from the current default branch and set `release_ref` to the existing tag
  rather than re-running an old tag-pinned workflow definition

Important consequence:

- if the prerelease publish path fails, stable promotion does not happen

### Release Drafter

Purpose:

- apply release-note labels on pull requests
- maintain a curated draft release for queued release-bearing work
- remove stale empty automated drafts when no release-bearing changes remain

This keeps the GitHub Releases page aligned with the actual release gate.

### Release Assets

Trigger:

- trusted `v*` tags
- manual `workflow_dispatch` with `release_ref=<tag>` for publish recovery

Published outputs:

- Linux binaries for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `arm`
- Debian runtime packages for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `armhf`
- Debian source package artifacts
- `sha256sums.txt`
- curated GitHub Release notes and assets

### Container Image

Triggers:

- pull requests for validation-only builds
- pushes to `main`
- trusted `v*` tags
- manual `workflow_dispatch` with `release_ref=<tag>` for publish recovery

Published channels:

- `ghcr.io/soakes/blackhole-threats:main` for the default branch
- `ghcr.io/soakes/blackhole-threats:rc` plus full `v*-rc.*` tags for release candidates
- stable semver tags and `latest` for promoted stable releases

### Publish Signed Debian Repository

Trigger:

- trusted stable `v*` tags only
- manual `workflow_dispatch` with `release_ref=<stable-tag>` for recovery

Outputs:

- Debian binary packages
- Debian source indexes
- signed `Release.gpg` and `InRelease`
- public archive key exports
- GitHub Pages landing site overlaid onto the repository root

Stable releases publish the machine-readable APT repository and the human-facing
landing page together.

### Deploy Pages Site

Trigger:

- pushes to `main`

Purpose:

- refresh the website without cutting a release
- reuse the latest published repository snapshot
- avoid rebuilding unsigned APT metadata for website-only changes

## Version Bump Rules

The semantic bump comes from commit history inspected by
`scripts/next-release.sh`.

Current rules:

- major:
  - `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  - `type!:` style conventional subjects
- minor:
  - `feat:`
- patch:
  - `fix:`
  - `perf:`
  - `revert:`
  - `container:`
  - `build:`
  - `deps:`
  - `packaging:`

These types do not cut a release by default:

- `docs:`
- `ci:`
- `chore:`
- `test:`
- `refactor:`

## Dependabot Path

Dependabot updates are part of the normal automation path.

Current behavior:

- Dependabot PRs run through `Build and Validate`
- green PRs can be merged directly by the dedicated Dependabot merge workflow
- when GitHub cannot merge immediately but the PR is otherwise eligible, the
  workflow enables GitHub auto-merge so the PR can land as soon as the
  remaining repository requirements are satisfied
- the original PR title is preserved as the squash commit subject
- `deps:` and `container:` updates remain release-bearing after merge
- `ci:` updates remain non-release-bearing
- patch, minor, and major version updates are all eligible for merge after
  validation
- the repo-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the default merge credential, and an
  optional `DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_TOKEN` can be added if workflow-file
  Dependabot PRs also need to merge automatically under GitHub's stricter
  workflow-permission rules
- the release workflows publish directly to the tagged GitHub Release rather
  than creating a temporary draft shell, and they clean up stale orphan
  `untagged-*` drafts for the same tag before publishing
- the repo-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` is also the default release-tag credential,
  and an optional `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` can be added if release-bearing
  commits under `.github/workflows/` need the extra workflow permission that
  GitHub requires for automated tag pushes

Operationally, this means passing dependency updates can flow all the way from
PR to RC to stable publication without manual intervention.

## Trust Boundaries

The release automation is deliberately strict because this is a public
repository.

Key constraints:

- release and publish tags must point to commits already contained in `main`
- pull requests do not receive publish or signing credentials
- write permissions are granted only to the jobs that need them
- APT signing secrets live in the protected `apt-repository` environment
- stable APT publication is restricted to stable tags, not `main`

## When Manual Intervention Is Still Needed

Automation is the default, but a maintainer still steps in when:

- `Build and Validate` fails on `main`
- a release-bearing commit updates `.github/workflows/` and
  `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` is not configured, so GitHub blocks the automated
  RC or stable tag push
- prerelease asset publication fails
- container publication fails
- APT signing or Pages publication fails
- a recovery promotion is needed via the manual promotion workflow
- a dependency update stays red and should not merge automatically

## What Does Not Create A Release

By default, these changes should not create a new runtime release on their own:

- documentation-only work
- README-only edits
- architecture-only edits
- website-only changes
- Pages-only refreshes
- CI-only changes using non-release-bearing commit types

Those changes may still refresh the landing site from `main`, but they should
not generate a new release tag unless they intentionally change shipped runtime,
container, packaging, or release-pipeline behavior.
