# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a single Go module with first-party packaging and release
automation.

- Keep the executable entrypoint in `cmd/blackhole-threats/`.
- Keep application code under `internal/`; do not add new top-level Go packages
  at the repo root.
- Keep root-level files for module, build, packaging, and release metadata only:
  `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, and repo config
  files belong at the root because the local tooling and GitHub workflows expect
  them there.
- `internal/buildinfo` is the canonical location for version, commit, and build
  date metadata injected at build time.
- `internal/config` owns YAML loading, feed definitions, and BGP community
  parsing.
- `internal/feed` owns feed retrieval, text/JSON parsing, and prefix
  summarisation.
- `internal/bgp` owns GoBGP lifecycle and route announce/withdraw logic.
- Keep operator-facing sample configuration in `examples/`.
- Keep container runtime assets under `packaging/container/`; the Docker image
  root filesystem and S6 service definitions belong there, not inline in the
  workflow files.
- Keep Debian packaging metadata in `debian/`.
- Keep release and repository automation scripts in `scripts/`.
- Keep architecture and design notes in `docs/`.
- Keep the GitHub Pages landing site in `website/`; treat it as the public
  frontend for the signed APT repository rather than as a throwaway marketing
  stub.
- Retired files should be removed from the working tree rather than left behind
  as dead alternatives.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Format Go code:
  ```bash
  make fmt
  ```
- Check formatting without rewriting files:
  ```bash
  make fmt-check
  ```
- Run static validation:
  ```bash
  make vet
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- Build the local binary:
  ```bash
  make build
  ```
- Build a cross-compiled binary:
  ```bash
  make build-cross GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 OUTPUT=dist/blackhole-threats-linux-arm64
  ```
- Build the container image locally:
  ```bash
  make docker-build
  ```
- Build the Debian package locally:
  ```bash
  make package
  ```
- Build the GitHub Pages site locally after installing `website/` dependencies:
  ```bash
  make website-build
  ```
- When editing the APT repository builder, at minimum syntax-check it:
  ```bash
  bash -n scripts/build-apt-repository.sh
  ```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Follow `.editorconfig`: Markdown, YAML, and JSON use 2-space indentation;
  Makefiles use tabs.
- Always run `gofmt`; do not hand-format Go code.
- Prefer small, focused internal packages with clear ownership rather than large
  shared utility layers.
- Keep public surface area small; prefer `internal/...` over adding new exported
  packages unless there is a clear reason.
- Prefer explicit, wrapped errors that preserve the failing path or operation.
- Keep logging operator-focused and actionable.
- Keep configuration examples realistic and ready to copy, not placeholder-heavy.
- Prefer descriptive workflow filenames and workflow `name:` values such as
  `build-and-validate.yml` or `publish-apt-repository.yml`; avoid vague names
  like `ci.yml` when the workflow has a narrower responsibility.
- Keep file and directory names stable when they are referenced by packaging,
  workflows, or documentation.

## Versioning, Release, and Packaging Rules

- The default branch is `main`.
- Stable release tags are `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and prerelease tags are
  `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.<n>`; do not invent a parallel tag scheme
  without updating the workflows, README, and release docs together.
- Local and CI builds derive version metadata from git and inject it through
  linker flags into `internal/buildinfo`; do not hardcode release versions in Go
  source files.
- `go.mod` tracks the minimum supported Go version for source builds and Debian
  packaging. Keep it buildable with the Go toolchain shipped by Debian trixie
  unless the Debian packaging strategy changes deliberately.
- GitHub Actions source builds may track the current stable Go release
  separately from `go.mod`, and the Docker build stage keeps its own pinned
  `GO_VERSION` in `Dockerfile`. Do not use the `go` directive in `go.mod` as a
  proxy for "latest CI Go version".
- Current release automation publishes Linux binaries for `amd64`, `arm64`, and
  `arm`, Debian binary packages for `amd64`, `arm64`, and `armhf`, Debian
  source package artifacts for tagged releases, and signed APT metadata
  including source indexes.
- Keep GitHub Release assets curated for operators: upload the runtime tarballs,
  non-dbgsym Debian packages, `sha256sums.txt`, and the Debian source package
  trio, but do not attach maintainer-oriented byproducts such as `-dbgsym`,
  `.buildinfo`, `.changes`, or a duplicate `release-notes.md` asset.
- `main` auto-cuts release candidates after `Build and Validate` succeeds,
  then promotes the same commit to a stable tag only after the prerelease asset
  and container publish paths pass. Keep `main` releasable enough for that
  automation.
- Release-note formatting is driven by `.github/release-drafter.yml`, the
  repository label catalog in `.github/repository-labels.json`, and the
  `Release Drafter` workflow. Keep those aligned when labels, categories, or
  version-bump expectations change.
- Keep `.github/release-drafter.yml` aligned with `scripts/next-release.sh`.
  Labels such as `documentation`, `ci`, and `maintenance` may still appear in
  grouped release notes, but they must not request a version bump on their own.
- `Makefile` is the source of truth for local build targets and build metadata
  wiring. Keep new local build or validation steps there when they are intended
  for contributors.
- Routine local builds should use Go's default cache locations. Do not add a
  repo-root `.cache/` workflow back to the top-level `Makefile` unless there is
  a specific CI or packaging need.
- Keep the binary name `blackhole-threats` unless the repository, Debian
  package, container image, service name, and documentation are all updated in
  the same change.
- Debian package installs should remain conventional and documented. If install
  paths change, update the packaging metadata and the README Debian section in
  the same change.
- Current Debian paths are:
  - `/usr/sbin/blackhole-threats`
  - `/etc/blackhole-threats.yaml`
  - `/etc/default/blackhole-threats`
  - `/usr/share/man/man8/blackhole-threats.8.gz`
  - `/usr/share/doc/blackhole-threats/examples/blackhole-threats.yaml`
- The Debian package and the GitHub Pages APT repository are both first-party
  deliverables. Do not treat Debian packaging as secondary or optional.
- The GitHub Pages root is both a human-facing landing site and the machine-
  readable APT repository root. Keep the landing page compatible with static
  hosting and do not break the `dists/`, `pool/`, or key download paths.
- Website-only GitHub Pages refreshes from `main` should reuse the latest
  published repository snapshot rather than forcing a new release tag or
  rebuilding unsigned repository metadata.
- Documentation-only, README-only, architecture-only, website-only, and
  Pages-only changes are non-release-bearing by default. They may refresh the
  GitHub Pages site from `main`, but they must not create or advance a release
  draft, release-candidate tag, or stable tag unless the same change also
  intentionally changes shipped runtime, container, Debian, or release-pipeline
  behavior.
- `scripts/build-apt-repository.sh` is expected to keep publishing both binary
  and source package indexes. Do not regress `deb-src` support.
- Keep Debian changelog entries factual, operator-facing, and suitable for an
  actual package archive; avoid speculative or placeholder wording.
- Keep `debian/control`, `debian/rules`, service files, defaults, and the README
  aligned whenever packaging behavior changes.

## Container Rules

- GHCR is the canonical published registry for this repository's container image.
- Keep the published image reference aligned with `ghcr.io/soakes/blackhole-threats`
  unless the repository owner or publishing design changes intentionally.
- Keep the Docker builder and runtime bases aligned with the supported Debian
  release line used by the repo.
- Keep the pinned `S6_OVERLAY_VERSION` and the matching checksum pins in
  `Dockerfile`; the scheduled refresh workflow updates them together.
- Container bootstrap behavior should continue to create or expose the sample
  config through `/config` as documented and smoke-tested by CI.
- Keep container platform coverage at `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` unless the
  workflows and README are updated together.
- If container paths, labels, runtime user expectations, or startup behavior
  change, update `Dockerfile`, `packaging/container/`, the container workflow,
  and the README container section together.

## GitHub Actions & Public Repo Security

- Treat this as a public repository. Favor least privilege and assume workflow
  changes are security-sensitive.
- Pull requests should validate code and packaging, but should not gain access
  to signing or publish credentials.
- Do not broaden workflow `permissions:` unless there is a clear operational
  need and the change is documented.
- Keep write permissions scoped to the specific publish jobs that need them.
- Container publishing is limited to pushes to `main` and trusted `v*` /
  `v*-rc.*` tags.
- Release publishing is limited to trusted `v*` / `v*-rc.*` tags.
- Signed APT repository publishing is limited to trusted stable `v*` tags.
- The separate landing-site Pages deploy may run from `main`, but it must only
  republish the website on top of the latest published repository snapshot; do
  not turn `main` pushes into unsigned APT repository rebuilds.
- Release and publish tags must point to commits already contained in `main`;
  keep that verification in place.
- Keep the scheduled toolchain/runtime refresh workflow branch-scoped and
  PR-based; it should update the root pins and open a reviewable pull request
  rather than pushing directly to `main`.
- Dependabot auto-merge should only act after `Build and Validate` succeeds for
  the PR head revision, and it should preserve the Dependabot pull request
  title as the squash commit subject so existing `deps:` / `container:` release
  automation still works after merge.
- Dependabot version-update automation intentionally does not semver-filter PRs:
  patch, minor, and major updates are all eligible to merge after successful
  validation, and the repo keeps enough Dependabot PR capacity that a failing
  major update does not block fresh update proposals.
- Keep the APT signing material in the protected `apt-repository` GitHub Actions
  environment. Do not move archive-signing secrets to broad repository-level
  secrets.
- Prefer the repo-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` for in-repo Dependabot merge automation
  under the current repository settings. Do not introduce a long-lived personal
  access token just to merge Dependabot PRs unless branch protection or GitHub
  App policy changes make that necessary. If workflow-file Dependabot PRs also
  need to merge automatically, the supported exception is an optional
  `DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_TOKEN` with the minimum extra workflow permission needed
  for that class of PR.
- If you change workflow behavior, update the README CI/CD, APT repository, or
  contribution sections in the same change when operator behavior changes.

## Testing Guidelines

- Minimum validation before opening or updating a PR that changes Go code:
  ```bash
  make fmt-check
  make vet
  make test
  make build
  ```
- If you change container behavior, also run:
  ```bash
  make docker-build
  ```
- If you change Debian packaging, install paths, service files, or release
  packaging, also run:
  ```bash
  make package
  ```
- If you change `website/` or GitHub Pages publishing behavior, also run:
  ```bash
  npm ci --prefix website
  npm --prefix website run check
  make website-build
  ```
- If you change `scripts/build-apt-repository.sh`, also run:
  ```bash
  bash -n scripts/build-apt-repository.sh
  ```
- Prefer targeted validation that matches the files changed, but do not skip the
  relevant packaging or publish-path checks when release behavior is affected.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Do not create commits unless the user explicitly asks for a commit in the
  current turn after reviewing the changes.
- Keep changes focused by concern: runtime logic, packaging, container, docs,
  and workflow hardening should be split when practical.
- Commits intended for `main` should follow a conventional format such as
  `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `ci: ...`, or `container: ...`.
- Write a meaningful commit body whenever the change affects operators,
  packaging, release behavior, or security posture. Automated versioning still
  reads commit history, and the fallback release-note path uses commit bodies
  when a change lands on `main` without a pull request.
- Automated version bumps treat `feat` as minor, `fix`/`perf`/`revert`/
  `container`/`build`/`deps`/`packaging` as patch, and `BREAKING CHANGE:` or
  `type!:` as major. `docs`, `ci`, `chore`, `test`, and `refactor` do not cut a
  release by default unless they are intentionally expressed with a
  release-bearing type.
- Pull request labels drive the polished GitHub release notes. Prefer the
  correct release-note label even when the autolabeler would infer it, and fix
  labels before merge rather than relying on the direct-commit fallback.
- If you choose a subject prefix, prefer clear conventional-style prefixes.
  Existing repo automation already uses `chore`, `ci`, `deps`, and `container`.
- Treat `main` as release-candidate-ready: after `Build and Validate` passes
  for a push to `main`, the release workflow can automatically create the next
  `v*-rc.*` tag from merged commit history, run the prerelease publish path,
  and then promote the same commit to a stable `v*` tag if those checks pass.
  Do not merge partial work to `main` that should not become a published
  prerelease.
- Unless the user explicitly asks for a stable release or promotion, default to
  the prerelease path first. If the user asks to "release", "tag", "ship", or
  "push a release" without clarifying stability, interpret that as "create or
  verify the next prerelease"; treat stable promotion as a separate explicit
  operator action.
- Docs-only, README-only, website-only, or CI-only landing-page updates should
  use the normal `main` push path and the Pages-site deploy workflow; do not
  cut a release tag just to refresh the public website.
- Do not hand-push routine `v*` or `v*-rc.*` tags. Automated tagging from
  `main` is the normal path; manual promotion or manual tags should be reserved
  for explicit recovery or operator-directed exceptions.
- Pull requests should explain:
  - the operational reason for the change
  - any routing, packaging, or upgrade impact
  - the exact validation performed
  - any documentation updates included
- Do not bundle unrelated workflow, packaging, and runtime refactors into one
  PR without a good reason.

## Documentation Sync

- Keep `README.md` aligned with the actual operator workflow. If install,
  release, container, or repository behavior changes, update the relevant README
  sections in the same change.
- Keep `docs/architecture.md` aligned with the real package/module boundaries
  when code ownership moves.
- If the configuration schema or operator defaults change, update
  `examples/blackhole-threats.yaml` and the matching README configuration text
  in the same change.
- If Debian-installed paths or service behavior change, update the README Debian
  package section.
- If APT publication, signing, or Pages behavior changes, update the README APT
  repository section.
- If workflow names, publish conditions, or security posture change, update the
  README CI/CD and contributing sections.

## Agent Behaviour & Task Scope

These rules apply specifically to AI coding agents working in this repository.

- Always read this file first before starting a task.
- Prefer targeted changes over wide refactors.
- Do not move `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, or the `debian/`
  directory without an explicit task that requires it.
- Do not weaken release, signing, or public-repo safety checks just to make CI
  simpler.
- Use subagents when it materially speeds up parallel-safe exploration or
  validation, but keep the immediate blocking implementation path in the main
  agent.
- When changing release or packaging behavior, inspect the matching workflow
  files rather than assuming the README is sufficient.
- When changing runtime behavior, inspect the relevant code under `cmd/` and
  `internal/` before editing docs.
- Do not introduce new third-party services, registries, or release channels
  without reflecting that in workflows, docs, and packaging.
- Leave the worktree ready for user review; do not create a commit unless asked.

## Exploration Checklist

Before making non-trivial changes, an agent should:

1. Read `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md` for the current operator-facing
   conventions.
2. Review `Makefile` before inventing new local build or test commands.
3. Review the relevant files under `.github/workflows/` before changing release,
   packaging, or publish behavior.
4. Review `debian/` before changing install paths, service behavior, or Debian
   metadata.
5. Review `packaging/container/` and `Dockerfile` together before changing
   container startup or filesystem layout.

## Self-Maintenance

- Keep this file current.
- If a repo convention changes, update this file in the same change.
- If a recurring misunderstanding is corrected during a task, document the
  corrected rule here.
- Do not remove an outdated rule without replacing it with the new repo truth.
